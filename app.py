Based on historical OQ documentation and deviation reports for 'XYZ reactor':
- The OQ protocol includes sensor calibration, alarm verification, and flow rate tests.
- Common deviations include inaccurate temperature probes and missed log entries.
- Suggested CAPA: pre-validation checklist and sensor double-check routine.
